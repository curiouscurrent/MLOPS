if the column you are looking to impute is normally distributed, use (mean + 3 sigma) or (mean - 3 sigma) , here sigma = standard deviation
-> basically we are imputing with the outlier 

if the column you are imputing is skewed, then follow the IQR proximity rule : 
IQR = Q3 - Q1
so fill it with either 
(Q1 - 1.5IQR)
(Q3 + 1.5IQR) 

25th percentile -> Q1
75TH PERCENTILE -> Q3
same disadvantages as mean median imputation
when to use ? 
when data is not missing at random, but in chunks, either 1st half, middle half, last half, etc.
