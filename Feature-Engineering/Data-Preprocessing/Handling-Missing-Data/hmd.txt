To perform CCA: 
1) Missing completely at random should be fulfilled
2) percentage of missing values in a column should be < 5% 

CCA : removing the rows, which have missing values in any of its columns completely from the dataset 
MCAR : doing CCA in a way such that the distribution of the data remains the same before and after performing CCA 

for numerical data : hist and pdf (Before CCA, After CCA)

for categorical data : ratio of categories before applying CCA = ratio of categories after applying CCA
