        "2) Always fit the scaler to the train set, it will learn the parameters.\n",

        "-In case of StandardScaler : the parameters learnt are mean and standard deviation of the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "-In case of MinMaxScaler : the parameters learnt are min and max values of the training data\n",
        "\n",
        "-In case of Mean Normalisation : the parameters learnt are mean,max,min values of the training data\n",
        "\n",
        "-In case of MaxAbsScaler : the parameters learnt are maximum absolute value of the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "-In case of RobustScaler : the parameters learnt are median and interquartile range of the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Then using these parameters transform the training and the test sets.\n",

        "2) most of the problems will be solved using standardisation.\n",

        "-> Minmax scaling : to be used when you know beforehand, the min and max value of your numerical quantity.\n",
        "Real life usecase : During image processing, we use CNN, and the color channels min value=0, max value=255, in this case we use MinMaxScaler.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Robust scaling : when your data has outliers\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Mean Normalisation : when you are working with centered data\n",

        "-> Max absolute scaling : when dealing with sparse data (meaning lots of 0's) , sparse matrix...\n",
        "\n",
        "4) When you have no idea -> go with Standard Scaler.\n"
